## compile
$ make autoscaler <br>
$ make load_balancer <br>
$ make server <br>
deploy server executable in virtual machines (setup server as startup process)

## run
$ ./load_balancer <br>
$ ./autoscaler

## note
this would work in same node, if server is in remote machine network config is required.
